## 🌎 Nice to meet you! 🍁

###  I'm Nicholas, a software developer with experience in robotics and SaaS products.

On a sunny day, you can find me outside reading a book with some ☕, or developing the latest project I've dreamed up (also with ☕). In fact, you'll probably find me with coffee most of the time 😁.

On a cold day, it's all the same except it's cold outside. ❄️⛄

Sometimes I like to just shake things up and pick something new. Like the time I was on a cheerleading team for a year. 💪

Check out my portfolio at (soon) [nicholaswengel.com](https://nicholaswengel.com)! The [code is here](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/PortfolioWebsite). It's built with React and Vite.

## Here's some of my projects:
| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Finance Aggregator](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/FinanceAggregator) | Aggregates financial data from multiple sources. Can't handle the hassle of standardizing the umpteen CSV formats your banks use?  This tool might be for you! |
| [Computer Vision: Shape Matcher](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/shape_matcher) | A tool I wrote as a deep learning alternative for a computer vision task. It uses properties of contrast in underwater images (and shape priors) to identify objects of interest. 🌊🌊🌊 |
| [ARVP Onboarding 2019 PDF](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/Onboarding2019) | A tutorial I wrote for new members of the Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Project to get up to speed. It walks developers through commanding a simulated 🤖 AUV to complete a simple obstacle course. |
| [Pre-University Projects](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/Pre-University-Projects) | A collection of 🎮 games I wrote to teach myself to code circa 2010-2017. |
| [YeetMind](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/neuro-car) | At HackeEd 2019 my team wrote a tool that maps EKG signals through an SVM to control a car. We won 3rd place! 🚗 |

🔭 I'm currently absorbing as much knowledge as possible while I look for my next big gig. If you've got an opportunity, I'd love to hear about it!
