## 🌎 Nice to meet you! 🍁

I'm Nicholas, a software developer with experience in robotics and SaaS products.

On a sunny day, you can find me reading a book with some ☕, or developing the latest project I've dreamed up (also with ☕). In fact, you'll probably find me with coffee most of the time 😁.

On a cold day, it's all the same except it's cold outside. ❄️⛄

Sometimes I like to just shake things up and pick something new. Like the time I was on a cheerleading team for a year. 💪

Check out my portfolio at (soon TM) [nicholaswengel.com](https://nicholaswengel.com)! The [code is here](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/PortfolioWebsite). It's built with React and Vite.

## Here's some of my projects:
- [Finance Aggregator](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/FinanceAggregator) aggregates financial data from multiple sources. Can't handle the hassle of standardizing the 😠 umpteen 😠 CSV formats your banks use?  This tool might be for you!
- [Computer Vision: Shape Matcher](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/shape_matcher): a tool I wrote as a deep learning alternative for a computer vision task. It uses properties of contrast in underwater images (and shape priors) to identify objects of interest. 🌊🌊🌊
- The [ARVP Onboarding 2019 PDF](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/Onboarding2019) is a tutorial I wrote for new members of the Autonomous Robotic Vehicle Project to get up to speed. It walks developers through commanding a simulated 🤖 AUV to complete a simple task.
- [A collection of 🎮 games I wrote to teach myself to code before University (2010-2017)](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/Pre-University-Projects).
- At HackeEd 2019 my team wrote [YeetMind](https://github.com/NinjaPerson24119/neuro-car), a tool that maps EKG signals through an SVM to control a car. We won 3rd place! 🚗🚗🚗

🔭 I'm currently absorbing as much knowledge as possible while I look for my next big gig. If you've got an opportunity, I'd love to hear about it!
